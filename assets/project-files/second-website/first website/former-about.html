	<p>If my website didn't give it away, my name is Maura. I am 24 years old living and working in Philly. I had always wanted to learn to code so in the fall of 2017 I began taking online classes and learning all I could about HTML and CSS so I could create my own website and showcase some of the work that I have done or am currently working on. Around that time I also decided to try Adobe Illustrator, and while I'm not the best artist out there I do enjoy it - you can find some of my work on sale on <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/maurafortino/">my redbubble page</a> or you can just head on over to my <a href="former-designs.html">designs page</a>.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>Outside of coding and being a subpar artist on illustrator, I keep myself busy travelling, writing, and learning new languages. I try to practice my Spanish, a langauge I've studied on and off since I was 12, every day in the hopes of finally becoming fluent and most recently I decided to learn Italian. I also really enjoy reading and have set a goal for myself to read on book a week this year - if you ever need a book recommendation hit me up!
