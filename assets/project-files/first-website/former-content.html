		<div class="text">As a senior in college, I joined the University Newspaper, The Chimes. During my time as a reporter I stepped outside of my comfort zone, met new people, and experienced a different side of campus. This experience helped improve my writing and managing multiple projects under a strict deadline. Click the photo to view my articles. </div>
		<div class="text">During the spring of 2015, I interned at a nonprofit, Alvis, which serves adults with developmental disabilities and those affected by the criminal justice system. I learned a lot at this internship and had the ability to create a variety of different materials. Click the photo above to view the brochure I created which explains the programs they offer.</div>
		<div class="text">In the fall of 2015, I created a public relations campaign for the Columbus School for Girls Summer Program after working as their communications coordinator. The goal of the campaign was to increase camper retention and registration numbers. Click on the photo above to view the research I conducted and social media calendar I created.</div>
		<div class="text">As a part of my capstone, I researched a political campaign and analyzed it using the Yale Five Stage Developmental Model. This project provided me with a better understanding of how campaigns work and I even presented it at a National Conference for Undergraduate Research.
