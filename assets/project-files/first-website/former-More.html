		  <li>I used to read while sitting upside down on the couch. While I don't sit upside down anymore, reading is still one of my favorite activities.&nbsp; One of my favorite books is <em>East of Eden </em>by John Steinbeck and favorite authors are Roxane Gay, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Rebecca Traister.</li>
		  <br>
			<li>Mumford & Sons is my all time favorite band (their song <em>Timshel</em> is inpsired by <em>East of Eden</em>). I've been to two of their concerts and even touched Marcus Mumford's hand - a top five moment in my life. </li><br>
			<li>I absolutely love dogs and have a slight obsession with pugs. I own over 20 articles of clothing and other trinkets dedicated to their adorable, squishy, little faces.</li><br>
			<li>Something I want to do in life is visit all fifty states before I turn fifty. I'm currently ahead of schedule by one with 25. </li>
			<li>I'm a lover of all food and have yet to have a meal I didn't like, but I absolutely despire bananas and refuse to eat or even be within smelling distance of them. </li><br>
